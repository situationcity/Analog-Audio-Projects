# Analog Audio Projects & Prototyping

This repository documents the design, prototyping, and assembly of custom analog audio equipment. 
The projects focus on signal path analysis, component selection, and noise reduction techniques.

## Project 1: High-Gain Distortion Pedal (TL072 Based)

**Current Status:**  *Phase 2: Breadboard Testing & Verification*

### 1. Circuit Schematic (Design Phase)
Hand-drawn technical schematic illustrating the signal flow, gain stages, and power filtration.
